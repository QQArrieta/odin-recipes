    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Crab Rangoon</strong> contains a simple mixture of crab, cream cheese, and seasonings<br> 
        wrapped in a wonton wrapper and fried crispy (or baked in the oven)!This easy<br> 
        recipe is a go-to at any Chinese restaurant but it is also super easy to make at home!<br>
        We love to dip our Crab Rangoon in a simple sweet and sour dip (just like our fave restaurant) for maximum flavor!
